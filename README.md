# react-CRUD
####CRUD app with ReactJS

This app is an experiment to create a Rails-backed ReactJS app with **RESTful** routes. 
To get started, clone the Repo, then `bundle install`, `rake db:migrate`, `rake db:seed`.

**** 

The only resource is `posts`. For each of the 7 essentials routes (`new`, `create`, `edit`, `update`, `show`, `index`, `destroy`), there is a corresponding **React** component. 


The app functions as a single-page application (**SPA**), meaning that there are no refreshes of the browser. Please feel free to fork the repo and make pull requests for changes / improvements.
